# Readable API Server

This repository includes the code for the light-weigth backend API Server that you'll use to develop and interact with the front-end portion of the project.

## Start Developing

To get started developing right away:

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, use Create React App to scaffold out the front-end
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm run start`

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
